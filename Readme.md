# Welcome to my Github

Passionate about the evolution of computer science (mathematical theories, hardware, software), I am specialized in low-level programming, agile management, design and development of software projects and processes, inter-departmental coordination, translation of research papers
into POC.
I am interested in machine learning and NLP research too.
